***Features Implemented So Far***

**1. User Input Handling**

* Used the readline function to read user input.
* Handled CTRL+D (EOF) to ensure the program exits.
* Displayed the prompt as minishell>.

**2. Empty Input Management**
Empty inputs ("") are ignored, and the shell continues waiting for valid commands.

**3. Argument Check**
Ensures the shell runs with exactly one argument (./minishell).
